# Rocket Engine Skateboard (2020)

## Overview  
As I've recently been becoming more and more interested in rocket propulsion systems, I've decided that I want to build one for myself and attach it to a longboard (or maybe bike because it is probably safer).

Others have made DIY rocket engine vehicles, but they usually use RC jet engines designed for RC planes like [this one](https://www.dreamworksrc.com/catalog/product/view/id/1434/s/jetcat-p100-rx-22-lbs-thrust-rc-turbine-engine/category/75/), which are absurdly expensive. Because of this, I want to design and build my own propulsion system for a fraction of the cost.

## Propulsion Systems in Consideration  
### [Cold Gas Thruster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_gas_thruster#/media/File:Cold_gas_thruster_diagram.png)  
**Thrust: ☆☆**
**Simplicity: ☆☆☆☆☆**
**Danger: ☆**
**Awesomeness: ☆☆**
A cold gas thruster essentially expels pressurized gas through a convergent-divergent nozzle, accelerating the gas to extremely high speeds. The pros of this propulsion system are that it is among the safest of my options (being that there is no combustion) and the propellant is cheap (you could just use air). However, there are a lot of downsides. Firstly, it doesn't look cool because there isn't fire shooting out the back. Secondly, unless implemented with a really well-made air pump, the refuel time would be quite long, which leads to another issue being that it will burn through fuel quickly. The last issue is the amount of thrust it can provide: I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure a cold gas thruster would have to be fairly large and heavy duty to provide 30+lbs of thrust for at least a minute, meaning that it wouldn't fit nicely on the end of a skateboard.

### [Steam Rocket Engine] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_rocket) 
A steam rocket engine is a variant of a thermal rocket engine that utilizes water. You may have made a steam rocket back in middle school science class because they are actually quite simple. It works by holding pressurized water in a heated tank. A sudden decrease in pressure turns the water to steam as it expels from the engine (usually through a convergent-divergent nozzle). A steam rocket engine would also be on the safer side, and it would look pretty cool too. The engineering behind making various pumps and heating systems to avoid having to preheat the water could be quite challenging, but probably not more challenging than the following engines.

### R-Candy Engine  
R-Candy is homemade solid rocket fuel, and it is surprisingly (and somewhat concerningly) simple to make.
