# Rocket Engine Skateboard (2020)

## Overview  
As I've recently been becoming more and more interested in rocket propulsion systems, I've decided that I want to build one for myself and attach it to a longboard (or maybe bike because it is probably safer).

Others have made DIY rocket engine vehicles, but they usually use RC jet engines designed for RC planes like [this one](https://www.dreamworksrc.com/catalog/product/view/id/1434/s/jetcat-p100-rx-22-lbs-thrust-rc-turbine-engine/category/75/), which are absurdly expensive. Because of this, I want to design and build my own propulsion system for a fraction of the cost.

For this project, I'll be focusing on a few metrics in particular in regards to the propulsion system: thrust, simplicity (making a turbojet engine from scratch is quite difficult), danger (making a turbojet engine from scratch probably won't end well), and awesomeness. Rocket engine skateboards are inherently pointless, so their only merit is how cool they are. 

## Propulsion Systems in Consideration  
### [Cold Gas Thruster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_gas_thruster#/media/File:Cold_gas_thruster_diagram.png)  
**Thrust: ☆☆**  
**Simplicity: ☆☆☆☆☆**  
**Danger: ☆**  
**Awesomeness: ☆☆**  
A cold gas thruster essentially expels pressurized gas through a convergent-divergent nozzle, accelerating the gas to extremely high speeds. The pros of this propulsion system are that it is among the safest of my options (being that there is no combustion) and the propellant is cheap (you could just use air). However, there are a lot of downsides. Firstly, it doesn't look cool because there isn't fire shooting out the back. Secondly, unless implemented with a really well-made air pump, the refuel time would be quite long, which leads to another issue being that it will burn through fuel quickly. The last issue is the amount of thrust it can provide: I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure a cold gas thruster would have to be fairly large and heavy duty to provide 30+lbs of thrust for at least a minute, meaning that it wouldn't fit nicely on the end of a skateboard.

### [Steam Rocket Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_rocket) 
**Thrust: ☆☆☆☆**  
**Simplicity: ☆☆☆**  
**Danger: ☆☆☆**  
**Awesomeness: ☆☆☆**  
A steam rocket engine is a variant of a thermal rocket engine that utilizes water. You may have made a steam rocket back in middle school science class because they are actually quite simple. It works by holding pressurized water in a heated tank. A sudden decrease in pressure turns the water to steam as it expels from the engine (usually through a convergent-divergent nozzle). A steam rocket engine would also be on the safer side, and it would look pretty cool too. The engineering behind making various pumps and heating systems to avoid having to preheat the water could be quite challenging, but probably not more challenging than the following engines.

### R-Candy Engine (Solid Fuel Engine)  
**Thrust: ☆☆☆**  
**Simplicity: ☆☆☆☆**  
**Danger: ☆☆☆**  
**Awesomeness: ☆☆☆☆**  
R-Candy is homemade solid rocket fuel, and it is surprisingly (and somewhat concerningly) simple to make: There are many variants of R-Candy, but the simplest just involves a 60/40 weight ratio of potassium nitrate (which is sold commercially as stump remover) and white sugar. After mixing these together and letting them sit on a pan at medium heat, they form a thick, brown paste that hardens into R-Candy. Unlike the other engines in which a mechanical or electrical system can be implemented to regulate the thrust output, R-Candy engines start burning and don't stop (as far as I know). This means it's easy to get more thrust: You just make more R-Candy. However, it also means that once the engine starts burning, you can't stop it until it runs out of fuel. I trust in my abilities to estimate how much R-Candy is safe through experimentation, but in general, cars without breaks cause accidents. While I don't think a full R-Candy engine will be my final design, I am definitely going to try it out.
